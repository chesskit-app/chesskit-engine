# ChessKitEngine 0.5.0
Released Tuesday, September 10, 2024.

### Engine Upgrades
* Update to [*Stockfish 17*](https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2024/stockfish-17).
  * See new recommended NNUE files [EvalFile](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns?network_name=1111cefa1111&user=) and [EvalFileSmall](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns?network_name=37f18f62d772&user=)
* Update to [*LeelaChessZero 0.31.1*](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases/tag/v0.31.1).

### Improvements
* `Engine.type` is now exposed publicly.

# ChessKitEngine 0.4.1
Released Monday, April 22, 2024.

### Bug Fixes
* Fix issue where engine responses containing a newline character would not be parsed correctly.

# ChessKitEngine 0.4.0
Released Monday, April 22, 2024.

### Engine Upgrades
* Update to [*Stockfish 16.1*](https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2024/stockfish-16-1/).
  * ⚠️ Stockfish now requires `EvalFile` and `EvalFileSmall` options to be set after launch, with a path to the `*.nnue` files provided.
  * Currently `chesskit-engine` assumes [`nn-baff1ede1f90.nnue`](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns?network_name=baff1ede1f90&user=), [`nn-b1a57edbea57.nnue`](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns?network_name=b1a57edbea57&user=) are available in your app's `Bundle.main`.
  * Click the file names in the previous line to access the download pages.
  * Any other files can be added via `.setoption(id:value:)` engine commands.
* Update to [*LeelaChessZero 0.30*](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases/tag/v0.30.0).
  * ⚠️ Lc0 requires `WeightsFile` options to be set after launch, with a path to a neural network file provided.
  * Currently `chesskit-engine` assumes `192x15_network` is available in your app's `Bundle.main`.
  * Network files can be downloaded from [lczero.org](https://lczero.org/play/bestnets/).
  * Any other files can be added via `.setoption(id:value:)` engine commands.
  * Currently there are some performance issues using `lc0` in an app; this is being investigated but any contributions (via PRs or issues) are appreciated.

### Improvements
* `Engine.start()` now takes a `completion` handler.
  * This is called once the engine has finished initializing.
  * Engine commands (i.e. setting options or requesting evaluations) should not be sent until this completion handler is called.
* `EngineMessenger` now sends commands to the engines via `stdin`, see [Issue #11](https://github.com/chesskit-app/chesskit-engine/issues/11).
  * This will allow for much simpler upgrades to existing engines, as well as the inclusion of new engines in the future.

# ChessKitEngine 0.3.0
Released Wednesday, March 27, 2024.

### Improvements
* Add background engine processing for better performance.
* Remove neural network resource files for greatly reduced package size.
  * These can be added manually by bundling the desired files and setting the appropriate engine to use them (see `Resources` directory).
  * For `Stockfish 15.1` (`nn-1337b1adec5b.nnue`):
    ``` swift
    engine.send(command: .setoption(id: "EvalFile", value: evalFileURL))
    engine.send(command: .setoption(id: "Use NNUE", value: "true"))
    ```
  * For `LeelaChessZero 0.29` (`192x15_network`):
    ``` swift
    engine.send(command: .setoption(id: "WeightsFile", value: weightsFileURL))
    ```
